## ValuerPro Final Product Vision & Purpose

### Core Purpose
ValuerPro is an **AI-Powered Professional Property Valuation Report System** designed for certified property valuers in Sri Lanka. The system automates and streamlines the entire valuation workflow from data collection to final report generation.

### How It Should Work (Final Product)

#### 1. **User Registration & Authentication**
- Valuers register with professional credentials
- JWT-based secure authentication
- Role-based access (Valuer, Admin)
- Profile management with certification details

#### 2. **Intelligent Report Creation Wizard**
**12-Step Comprehensive Workflow:**
1. **Report Information** - Basic report details, client info
2. **Property Identification** - Lot numbers, plan details, ownership
3. **Location Details** - GPS coordinates, administrative divisions
4. **Site Characteristics** - Topography, soil, boundaries
5. **Legal Information** - Title deeds, encumbrances, restrictions
6. **Locality Analysis** - Neighborhood characteristics, development
7. **Planning & Zoning** - Building regulations, zoning restrictions
8. **Utilities Assessment** - Water, electricity, sewerage, telecom
9. **Transport & Access** - Road access, public transport, distances
10. **Environmental Factors** - NBRO clearance, hazards, climate
11. **Market Analysis** - Comparable sales, market trends
12. **Appendices** - Supporting documents, photos, plans

#### 3. **AI-Powered Data Extraction**
- **OCR Integration**: Upload property documents (deeds, plans, surveys)
- **Google Vision API**: Extract text from documents with 98% accuracy
- **AI Processing**: GPT-4 analyzes extracted text and auto-fills form fields
- **Multi-file Support**: Handle multiple PDFs, images simultaneously
- **Smart Field Mapping**: Automatically populate wizard steps from document data

#### 4. **Location Intelligence**
- **Google Maps Integration**: Reverse geocoding, satellite views
- **Administrative Data**: Auto-fill GN divisions, DS divisions, districts
- **Proximity Analysis**: Calculate distances to schools, hospitals, landmarks
- **Transport Access**: Public transport routes, nearest stations
- **Direction Generation**: Automated access directions from major cities

#### 5. **Regulatory Intelligence**
- **Zoning Detection**: Identify applicable building regulations
- **UDA Integration**: Urban Development Authority regulations lookup
- **NBRO Clearance**: Landslide risk assessment and clearance requirements
- **Local Authority Rules**: Municipal/council-specific regulations
- **Automated Compliance**: Check property against current regulations

#### 6. **Professional Report Generation**
- **PDF Export**: Professional format with letterhead, signatures
- **DOCX Export**: Editable format for customization
- **Template System**: Standardized layouts meeting industry standards
- **Auto-formatting**: Consistent styling, numbering, references
- **Digital Signatures**: Secure valuer authentication

#### 7. **Data Management**
- **Report Library**: Search, filter, organize all reports
- **Client Management**: Track clients, properties, valuations
- **Document Storage**: Secure cloud storage for all files
- **Backup & Sync**: Automated data protection
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Performance metrics, report statistics

## Your Testing & Analysis Tasks

### 1. **Comprehensive Functionality Testing**

#### Frontend Testing
- [ ] Test user registration and login flows
- [ ] Navigate through all 12 wizard steps
- [ ] Test form validation and data persistence
- [ ] Check responsive design on different screen sizes
- [ ] Verify file upload functionality
- [ ] Test navigation, breadcrumbs, and UI consistency
- [ ] Check error handling and user feedback

#### Backend API Testing
- [ ] Test all authentication endpoints
