# Task 1.2 Complete - Create Edit Route and Enhance WizardProvider LoadReport

## ✅ COMPLETED: Task 1.2 - Create edit route and enhance WizardProvider loadReport functionality

### What was implemented:
- ✅ Created comprehensive `/reports/[id]/edit` route using full wizard interface
- ✅ Enhanced WizardProvider to support `editMode` and `reportId` props
- ✅ Completely enhanced `loadReport()` function to fetch all related data:
  - Report basic information (ref, purpose, dates, client, etc.)
  - Property data (identification, location, site, buildings, utilities, planning, locality, legal)
  - Valuation data (lines and summary)
  - Files and appendices (documents, photos)
  - OCR results integration
- ✅ Automatic data loading when entering edit mode
- ✅ Pre-population of all wizard steps with existing report data
- ✅ Added `getById` method to reportsAPI for consistency

### Changes made to files:
- `frontend/src/app/reports/[id]/edit/page.tsx`: Complete rewrite to use wizard interface
- `frontend/src/components/wizard/WizardProvider.tsx`: Enhanced with edit mode support and comprehensive data loading
- `frontend/src/lib/api.ts`: Added getById method for consistency

### Key improvements:
1. **Full wizard editing**: Users can now edit reports using the same comprehensive wizard interface used for creation
2. **Comprehensive data loading**: All report sections are automatically pre-filled with existing data
3. **Seamless user experience**: Edit flow identical to creation flow with all data populated
4. **Robust error handling**: Proper loading states and error management
5. **Auto-save integration**: Existing auto-save functionality works in edit mode

### Technical highlights:
- **Parallel data fetching**: Loads report, properties, files, and OCR results simultaneously for performance
- **Data transformation**: Converts backend data structure to wizard-compatible format
- **Fallback handling**: Graceful handling of missing or incomplete data
- **Type safety**: Proper TypeScript integration throughout

### Next steps:
- Task 1.3: Implement View action for PDF/DOCX report generation
- Continue with Task 2.1: Enhance FileUpload component

### Status: ✅ COMPLETE
Date completed: 2025-01-29
